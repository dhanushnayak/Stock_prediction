# Stock_prediction using LSTM
# Steps Followed
1.  Data Collection<br>
2.  Using Parameter<br>
3.  Data preprocessing with respect to time<br>
4.  LSTM Model with input of Time shift in step 3 and 1 as input, Data of x must be 3-demision for LSTM<br>
5.  Identify the predict model with window shift<br>
6.  Logic of Shifting data by extending times series data + yhat output for each itertion AS FORECASTING<br>
